# Credit Risk Analysis Report

**Overview**

The purpose of the analysis was to train and evalute a logistic regression model that has the ability to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. In order to create the model, we were given a dataset of historical lending activities which includes the following information per borrower: loan size, interest rate, income, deb to income ratio, number of credit accounts open, derogatory marks (history of financial difficulties), and the total debt accumulation. Taking into consideration the borrowers' profile, I needed to predict healthy loans (0) and loans at high-risk of defauling (1). In the historical dataset, there were 56,271 healthy loans and 1,881 high-risk loans that were reported.

**Results**

* Overall acccuracy score --> 99%
* For healthy loans the precision and recall scores were 100% and 99% respectively
* For loans at risk of defaulting, the precision and recall scores were 85% and 95% respectively

**Summary**
Taking into account the results of the model, I would recommend the use of logisitic regression because it is good at identifying borrowers with healthy loans as well as those who are at high-risk of defaultin. In the case of this analysis, it would be crucial and beneficial to predict the those who are at high-risk of defaulting.
