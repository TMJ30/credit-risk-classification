# Credit Risk Analysis Report

**Overview**

The purpose of the analysis was to train and evalute a logistic regression model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. In order to create the model, we were given a dataset of historical lending activities including the following information per borrower: loan size, interest rate, income, deb to income ratio, number of credit accounts open, derogatory marks (history of financial difficulties), and the total debt accumulation. Taking into consideration these factors, we needed to predict borrowers who have health loans and those who were at risk of defaulting. COME BACK TO THIS SECTION
