# Credit Risk Analysis Report

**Overview**

The purpose of the analysis was to train and evalute a logistic regression model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. In order to create the model, we were given a dataset of historical lending activities including the following information per borrower: loan size, interest rate, income, deb to income ratio, number of credit accounts open, derogatory marks (history of financial difficulties), and the total debt accumulation. Taking into consideration these factors, we needed to predict borrowers who have healthy loans (0) and those who were at high-risk of defaulting (1). COME BACK TO THIS SECTION


**Results**

* Overall acccuracy score --> 99%
* For healthy loans the precision and recall scores were 100% and 99% respectively
* For loans at risk of defaulting, the precision and recall scores were 85% and 95% respectively

**Summary**
Overall, the logisitic regression model does well at predicting healthy loans and high-risk loans with a relatively low number of errors in its predictions. In the case of this analysis, it was more important to predict the borrowers who are at high-risk of defaulting, there for also taking into account the models
